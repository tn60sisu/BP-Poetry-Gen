since feeling is first
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world
my blood approves
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers.
Don"t cry
—the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids" flutter which says
we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life"s not a paragraph
and death i think is no parenthesis
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day"s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood"s faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints.
I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.
I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I
Did, till we loved?
Were we not weaned till then?
But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den?
’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.
If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.
And now good-morrow to our waking souls,
Which watch not one another out of fear;
For love, all love of other sights controls,
And makes one little room an everywhere.
Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,
Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.
My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;
Where can we find two better hemispheres,
Without sharp north, without declining west?
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;
If our two loves be one, or, thou and I
Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.
Happy the man, and happy he alone,
He who can call today his own:
He who, secure within, can say,
Tomorrow do thy worst, for I have lived today.
Be fair or foul or rain or shine
The joys I have possessed, in spite of fate, are mine.
Not Heaven itself upon the past has power,
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.
Of Manners gentle , of Affections mild ;
In Wit , a Man ; Simplicity , a Child :
With native Humour temp"ring virtuous Rage ,
Form "d to delight at once and lash the age :
Above Temptation , in a low Estate ,
And uncorrupted , ev"n among the Great :
A safe Companion , and an easy Friend ,
Unblam "d thro ’ Life , lamented in thy End .
These are Thy Honours !
not that here thy Bust
Is mix "d with Heroes , or with Kings thy dust ;
But that the Worthy and the Good shall say ,
Striking their pensive bosoms — Here lies GAY .
Music , when soft voices die ,
Vibrates in the memory —
Odours , when sweet violets sicken ,
Live within the sense they quicken .
Rose leaves , when the rose is dead ,
Are heaped for the beloved "s bed ;
And so thy thoughts , when thou art gone ,
Love itself shall slumber on .
The sun is warm , the sky is clear ,
The waves are dancing fast and bright ,
Blue isles and snowy mountains wear
The purple noon "s transparent might ,
The breath of the moist earth is light ,
Around its unexpanded buds ;
Like many a voice of one delight ,
The winds , the birds , the ocean floods ,
The City "s voice itself , is soft like Solitude "s .
I see the Deep "s untrampled floor
With green and purple seaweeds strown ;
I see the waves upon the shore ,
Like light dissolved in star-showers , thrown :
I sit upon the sands alone ,—
The lightning of the noontide ocean
Is flashing round me , and a tone
Arises from its measured motion ,
How sweet !
did any heart now share in my emotion .
Alas !
I have nor hope nor health ,
Nor peace within nor calm around ,
Nor that content surpassing wealth
The sage in meditation found ,
And walked with inward glory crowned —
Nor fame , nor power , nor love , nor leisure .
Others I see whom these surround —
Smiling they live , and call life pleasure ;—
To me that cup has been dealt in another measure .
Yet now despair itself is mild ,
Even as the winds and waters are ;
I could lie down like a tired child ,
And weep away the life of care
Which I have borne and yet must bear ,
Till death like sleep might steal on me ,
And I might feel in the warm air
My cheek grow cold , and hear the sea
Breathe o"er my dying brain its last monotony .
Some might lament that I were cold ,
As I , when this sweet day is gone ,
Which my lost heart , too soon grown old ,
Insults with this untimely moan ;
They might lament — for I am one
Whom men love not ,— and yet regret ,
Unlike this day , which , when the sun
Shall on its stainless glory set ,
Will linger , though enjoyed , like joy in memory yet .
Break , break , break ,
On thy cold gray stones , O Sea !
And I would that my tongue could utter
The thoughts that arise in me .
O well for the fisherman "s boy ,
That he shouts with his sister at play !
O well for the sailor lad ,
That he sings in his boat on the bay !
And the stately ships go on
To their haven under the hill ;
But O for the touch of a vanish "d hand ,
And the sound of a voice that is still !
Break , break , break ,
At the foot of thy crags , O Sea !
But the tender grace of a day that is dead
Will never come back to me .
TAKE up the White Man"s burden -
Send forth the best ye breed -
Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives" need;
To wait in heavy harness
On fluttered folk and wild -
Your new-caught sullen peoples,
Half devil and half child.
Take up the White Man"s burden -
In patience to abide
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple,
An hundred times made plain,
To seek another"s profit,
And work another"s gain.
Take up the White Man"s burden -
The savage wars of peace -
Fill full the mouth of famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought,
Watch Sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.
Take up the White Man"s burden -
No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper -
The tale of common things.
The ports ye shall not enter,
The roads ye shall not tread,
Go make them with your living,
And mark them with your dead !
Take up the White Man"s burden -
And reap his old reward,
The blame of those ye better,
The hate of those ye guard -
The cry of hosts ye humour
(Ah slowly !)
towards the light:-
"Why brought ye us from bondage,
"Our loved Egyptian night ?"
Take up the White Man"s burden -
Ye dare not stoop to less -
Nor call too loud on Freedom
To cloak your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper,
By all ye leave or do,
The silent sullen peoples
Shall weigh your Gods and you.
Take up the White Man"s burden -
Have done with childish days -
The lightly proffered laurel,
The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood
Through all the thankless years,
Cold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,
The judgement of your peers.
They shut the road through the woods
Seventy years ago.
Weather and rain have undone it again,
And now you would never know
There was once a road through the woods
Before they planted the trees.
It is underneath the coppice and heath,
And the thin anemones.
Only the keeper sees
That, where the ring-dove broods,
And the badgers roll at ease,
There was once a road through the woods.
Yet, if you enter the woods
Of a summer evening late,
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools
Where the otter whistles his mate,
(They fear not men in the woods,
Because they see so few.)
You will hear the beat of a horse’s feet,
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,
Steadily cantering through
The misty solitudes,
As though they perfectly knew
The old lost road through the woods.
But there is no road through the woods.
O rose , thou art sick !
The invisible worm ,
That flies in the night ,
In the howling storm ,
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy ,
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy .
I was angry with my friend :
I told my wrath , my wrath did end .
I was angry with my foe :
I told it not , my wrath did grow .
And I watered it in fears
Night and morning with my tears ,
And I sunned it with smiles
And with soft deceitful wiles .
Earth has not anything to show more fair:
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty:
This City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning: silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields, and to the sky;
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;
Ne’er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will:
Dear God!
the very houses seem asleep;
And all that mighty heart is lying still!
My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless;
That only men incredulous of despair,
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air
Beat upward to God’s throne in loud access
Of shrieking and reproach.
Full desertness,
In souls as countries, lieth silent-bare
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare
Of the absolute heavens.
Deep-hearted man, express
Grief for thy dead in silence like to death—
Most like a monumental statue set
In everlasting watch and moveless woe
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.
Touch it; the marble eyelids are not wet:
If it could weep, it could arise and go.
Let the world "s sharpness , like a clasping knife ,
Shut in upon itself and do no harm
In this close hand of Love , now soft and warm ,
And let us hear no sound of human strife
After the click of the shutting .
Life to life —
I lean upon thee , Dear , without alarm ,
And feel as safe as guarded by a charm
Against the stab of worldlings , who if rife
Are weak to injure .
Very-whitely still
The lilies of our lives may reassure
Their blossoms from their roots , accessible
Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer
Growing straight , out of man "s reach , on the hill .
God only , who made us rich , can make us poor .
AH, how sweet it is to love!
Ah, how gay is young Desire!
And what pleasing pains we prove
When we first approach Love"s fire!
Pains of love be sweeter far
Than all other pleasures are.
Sighs which are from lovers blown
Do but gently heave the heart:
Ev"n the tears they shed alone
Cure, like trickling balm, their smart:
Lovers, when they lose their breath,
Bleed away in easy death.
Love and Time with reverence use,
Treat them like a parting friend;
Nor the golden gifts refuse
Which in youth sincere they send:
For each year their price is more,
And they less simple than before.
Love, like spring-tides full and high,
Swells in every youthful vein;
But each tide does less supply,
Till they quite shrink in again:
If a flow in age appear,
"Tis but rain, and runs not clear.
FROM harmony , from heavenly harmony
This universal frame began :
When nature underneath a heap
Of jarring atoms lay ,
And could not heave her head ,
The tuneful voice was heard from high ,
Arise , ye more than dead .
Then cold , and hot , and moist , and dry ,
In order to their stations leap ,
And Music "s power obey .
From harmony , from heavenly harmony
This universal frame began :
From harmony to harmony
Through all the compass of the notes it rail ,
The diapason closing full in Man .
What passion cannot Music raise and quell ?
When Jubal struck the chorded shell ,
His listening brethren stood around ,
And , wondering , on their faces fell
To worship that celestial sound .
Less than a God they thought there could not dwell
Within the hollow of that shell ,
That spoke so sweetly and so well .
What passion cannot Music raise and quell ?
The trumpet "s loud clangour
Excites us to arms ,
With shrill notes of anger ,
And mortal alarms .
The double double double beat
Of the thundering drum
Cries , hark !
the foes come ;
Charge , charge !
" tis too late to retreat .
The soft complaining flute
In dying notes discovers
The woes of hopeless lovers ,
Whose dirge is whisper "d by the warbling lute .
Sharp violins proclaim
Their jealous pangs , and desperation ,
Fury , frantic indignation ,
Depth of pains , and height of passion ,
For the fair , disdainful dame .
But oh !
what art can teach ,
What human voice can reach ,
The sacred organ "s praise ?
Notes inspiring holy love ,
Notes that wing their heavenly ways
To mend the choirs above .
Orpheus could lead the savage race ;
And trees uprooted left their place ,
Sequacious of the lyre :
But bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher :
When to her organ vocal breath was given ,
An angel heard , and straight appear "d ,
Mistaking earth for heaven .
The flower that smiles to-day
To-morrow dies ;
All that we wish to stay
Tempts and then flies .
What is this world "s delight ?
Lightning that mocks the night ,
Brief even as bright .
Virtue , how frail it is !
Friendship how rare !
Love , how it sells poor bliss
For proud despair !
But we , though soon they fall ,
Survive their joy , and all
Which ours we call .
Whilst skies are blue and bright ,
Whilst flowers are gay ,
Whilst eyes that change ere night
Make glad the day ;
Whilst yet the calm hours creep ,
Dream thou — and from thy sleep
Then wake to weep .
John Anderson , my jo , John ,
When we were first acquent ;
Your locks were like the raven ,
Your bonie brow was brent ;
But now your brow is beld , John ,
Your locks are like the snaw ;
But blessings on your frosty pow ,
John Anderson , my jo .
John Anderson , my jo , John ,
We clamb the hill thegither ;
And mony a cantie day , John ,
We "ve had wi ’ ane anither :
Now we maun totter down , John ,
And hand in hand we "ll go ,
And sleep thegither at the foot ,
John Anderson , my jo .
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action : and till action , lust
Is perjur "d , murderous , bloody , full of blame ,
Savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust ;
Enjoy "d no sooner but despised straight ;
Past reason hunted ; and no sooner had ,
Past reason hated , as a swallow "d bait ,
On purpose laid to make the taker mad :
Mad in pursuit and in possession so ;
Had , having , and in quest , to have extreme ;
A bliss in proof ,— and prov "d , a very woe ;
Before , a joy propos "d ; behind a dream .
All this the world well knows ; yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell .
When my love swears that she is made of truth ,
I do believe her , though I know she lies ,
That she might think me some untutor "d youth ,
Unskilful in the world "s false forgeries ,
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young ,
Although I know my years be past the best ,
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue ,
Outfacing faults in love with love "s ill rest .
But wherefore says my love that she is young ?
And wherefore say not I that I am old ?
O , love "s best habit is a soothing tongue ,
And age , in love , loves not to have years told .
Therefore , I "ll lie with love , and love with me ,
Since that our faults in love thus smother "d be .
Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.
Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;
For tho’ from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar.
Tyger , tyger , burning bright
In the forests of the night ,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry ?
In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes ?
On what wings dare he aspire ?
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart ?
And , when thy heart began to beat ,
What dread hand and what dread feet ?
What the hammer ?
what the chain ?
In what furnace was thy brain ?
What the anvil ?
what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp ?
When the stars threw down their spears ,
And watered heaven with their tears ,
Did he smile his work to see ?
Did he who made the lamb make thee ?
Tyger , tyger , burning bright
In the forests of the night ,
What immortal hand or eye
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry ?
A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
He holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel the strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agamemnon dead.
Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?
Half a league , half a league ,
Half a league onward ,
All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred .
‘ Forward , the Light Brigade !
’
‘ Charge for the guns !
’ he said :
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred .
‘ Forward , the Light Brigade !
’
Was there a man dismay "d ?
Not tho ’ the soldier knew
Some one had blunder "d :
Their "s not to make reply ,
Their "s not to reason why ,
Their "s but to do and die :
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred .
Cannon to right of them ,
Cannon to left of them ,
Cannon in front of them
Volley "d and thunder "d ;
Storm "d at with shot and shell ,
Boldly they rode and well ,
Into the jaws of Death ,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred .
Flash "d all their sabres bare ,
Flash "d as they turn "d in air ,
Sabring the gunners there ,
Charging an army , while
All the world wonder "d :
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right thro ’ the line they broke ;
Cossack and Russian
Reel "d from the sabre-stroke
Shatter "d and sunder "d .
Then they rode back , but not
Not the six hundred .
Cannon to right of them ,
Cannon to left of them ,
Cannon behind them
Volley "d and thunder "d ;
Storm "d at with shot and shell ,
While horse and hero fell ,
They that had fought so well
Came thro ’ the jaws of Death ,
Back from the mouth of Hell ,
All that was left of them ,
Left of six hundred .
When can their glory fade ?
O the wild charge they made !
All the world wondered .
Honor the charge they made !
Honor the Light Brigade ,
Noble six hundred !
Pain has an element of blank ;
It cannot recollect
When it began , or if there were
A day when it was not .
It has no future but itself ,
Its infinite realms contain
Its past , enlightened to perceive
New periods of pain .
I taste a liquor never brewed ,
From tankards scooped in pearl ;
Not all the vats upon the Rhine
Yield such an alcohol !
Inebriate of air am I ,
And debauchee of dew ,
Reeling , through endless summer days ,
From inns of molten blue .
When landlords turn the drunken bee
Out of the foxglove "s door ,
When butterflies renounce their drams ,
I shall but drink the more !
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats ,
And saints to windows run ,
To see the little tippler
Leaning against the sun !
Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art—
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching, with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s patient, sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priestlike task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors—
No—yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever—or else swoon to death.
My spirit is too weak—mortality
Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
And each imagined pinnacle and steep
Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.
Yet ‘tis a gentle luxury to weep,
That I have not the cloudy winds to keep,
Fresh for the opening of the morning’s eye.
Such dim-conceived glories of the brain
Bring round the heart an indescribable feud;
So do these wonders a most dizzy pain,
That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude
Wasting of old Time—with a billowy main—
A sun—a shadow of a magnitude.
Ye flowery banks o ’ bonie Doon ,
How can ye blume sae fair ?
How can ye chant , ye little birds ,
And I sae fu ’ o care !
Thou "ll break my heart , thou bonie bird ,
That sings upon the bough !
Thou minds me o ’ the happy days
When my fause Luve was true .
Thou "ll break my heart , thou bonie bird ,
That sings beside thy mate ;
For sae I sat , and sae I sang ,
And wist na o ’ my fate .
Aft hae I rov "d by bonie Doon ,
To see the woodbine twine ;
And ilka bird sang o ’ its Luve ,
And sae did I o ’ mine .
Wi ’ lightsome heart I pu "d a rose ,
Upon its thorny tree ;
But my fause Luver staw my rose ,
And left the thorn wi ’ me .
Wi ’ lightsome heart I pu "d a rose ,
Upon a morn in June ;
And sae I flourished on the morn ,
And sae was pu "d or noon .
Is there for honest Poverty
That hings his head , an ’ a ’ that ;
The coward slave — we pass him by ,
We dare be poor for a ’ that !
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that .
Our toils obscure an ’ a ’ that ,
The rank is but the guinea "s stamp ,
The Man "s the gowd for a ’ that .
What though on hamely fare we dine ,
Wear hoddin grey , an ’ a that ;
Gie fools their silks , and knaves their wine ;
A Man "s a Man for a ’ that :
For a ’ that , and a ’ that ,
Their tinsel show , an ’ a ’ that ;
The honest man , tho ’ e"er sae poor ,
Is king o ’ men for a ’ that .
Ye see yon birkie , ca "d a lord ,
Wha struts , an ’ stares , an ’ a ’ that ;
Tho ’ hundreds worship at his word ,
He "s but a coof for a ’ that :
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that ,
His ribband , star , an ’ a ’ that :
The man o ’ independent mind
He looks an ’ laughs at a ’ that .
A prince can mak a belted knight ,
A marquis , duke , an ’ a ’ that ;
But an honest man "s abon his might ,
Gude faith , he maunna fa ’ that !
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that ,
Their dignities an ’ a ’ that ;
The pith o ’ sense , an ’ pride o ’ worth ,
Are higher rank than a ’ that .
Then let us pray that come it may ,
( As come it will for a ’ that ,)
That Sense and Worth , o"er a ’ the earth ,
Shall bear the gree , an ’ a ’ that .
For a ’ that , an ’ a ’ that ,
It "s coming yet for a ’ that ,
That Man to Man , the world o"er ,
Shall brothers be for a ’ that .
They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens ,
And along the trampled edges of the street
I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
Sprouting despondently at area gates .
The brown waves of fog toss up to me
Twisted faces from the bottom of the street ,
And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
An aimless smile that hovers in the air
And vanishes along the level of the roofs .
The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways .
Six o"clock .
The burnt-out ends of smoky days .
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots ;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots ,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps .
And then the lighting of the lamps .
The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands .
With the other masquerades
That time resumes ,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms .
You tossed a blanket from the bed ,
You lay upon your back , and waited ;
You dozed , and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted ;
They flickered against the ceiling .
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters ,
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters ,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands ;
Sitting along the bed "s edge , where
You curled the papers from your hair ,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands .
His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block ,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six o"clock
And short square fingers stuffing pipes ,
And evening newspapers , and eyes
Assured of certain certainties ,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world .
I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images , and cling :
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing .
Wipe your hand across your mouth , and laugh ;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots .
Nor dread nor hope attend
A dying animal;
A man awaits his end
Dreading and hoping all;
Many times he died,
Many times rose again,
A great man in his pride
Confronting murderous men
Casts derision upon
Supersession of breath;
He knows death to the bone –
Man has created death.
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
Are full of passionate intensity.
Surely some revelation is at hand;
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
The Second Coming!
Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
The darkness drops again; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
Of all the Poisons that the fruitful Earth
E"er yet brought forth , or Monsters she gave Birth ,
Nought to Mankind has e"er so fatal been ,
As thou , accursed Gold , their Care and Sin .
Methinks I the Advent"rous Merchant see ,
Ploughing the faithless Seas , in search of thee ,
His dearest Wife and Children left behind ,
( His real Wealth ) while he , a Slave to th ’ Wind ,
Sometimes becalm "d , the Shore with longing Eyes
Wishes to see , and what he wishes , Spies :
For a rude Tempest wakes him from his Dream ,
And Strands his Bark by a more sad Extream .
Thus , hopless Wretch , is his whole Life-time spent ,
And though thrice Wreck"t , ‘ s no Wiser than he went .
Again , I see , the Heavenly Fair despis "d ,
A Hagg like Hell , with Gold , more highly priz "d ;
Mens Faith betray "d , their Prince and Country Sold ,
Their God deny "d , all for the Idol Gold .
Unhappy Wretch , who first found out the Oar ,
What kind of Vengeance rests for thee in store ?
If Nebats Son , that Israel led astray ,
Meet a severe Reward at the last Day ?
Some strange unheard-of Judgement thou wilt find ,
Who thus hast caus "d to Sin all Humane Kind .
When first Alexis did in Verse delight ,
His Muse in Low , but Graceful Numbers walk"t ,
And now and then a little Proudly stalk"t ;
But never aim "d at any noble Flight :
The Herds , the Groves , the gentle purling Streams ,
Adorn "d his Song , and were his highest Theams .
But Love these Thoughts , like Mists , did soon disperse ,
Enlarg "d his Fancy , and set free his Muse ,
Biding him more Illustrious Subjects choose ;
The Acts of Gods , and God-like Men reherse .
From thence new Raptures did his Breast inspire ,
His scarce Warm-Heart converted was to Fire .
Th ’ exalted Poet rais "d by this new Flame ,
With Vigor flys , where late he crept along ,
And Acts Divine , in a Diviner Song ,
Commits to the eternal Trompe of Fame .
And thus Alexis does prove Love to be ,
As the Worlds Soul , the Soul of Poetry .
Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne"er succeed .
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need .
Not one of all the purple host
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition ,
So clear , of victory ,
As he , defeated , dying ,
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break , agonized and clear !
I felt a funeral in my brain ,
And mourners , to and fro ,
Kept treading , treading , till it seemed
That sense was breaking through .
And when they all were seated ,
A service like a drum
Kept beating , beating , till I thought
My mind was going numb .
And then I heard them lift a box ,
And creak across my soul
With those same boots of lead , again .
Then space began to toll
As all the heavens were a bell ,
And Being but an ear ,
And I and silence some strange race ,
Wrecked , solitary , here .
And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down -
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing - then -
WHEN I consider how my light is spent
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
And that one Talent which is death to hide
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest He returning chide,
“Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”
I fondly ask.
But Patience, to prevent
That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need
Either man’s work or his own gifts.
Who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best.
His state
Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,
And post o’er land and ocean without rest;
They also serve who only stand and wait.”
HOW soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year!
My hasting days fly on with full career,
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.
Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth,
That I to manhood am arrived so near,
And inward ripeness doth much less appear,
That some more timely-happy spirits indu’th.
Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow,
It shall be still in strictest measure even
To that same lot, however mean or high,
Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven,
All is, if I have grace to use it so,
As ever in my great Task-master’s eye
THERE was never a sound beside the wood but one ,
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground .
What was it it whispered ?
I knew not well myself ;
Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun ,
Something , perhaps , about the lack of sound —
And that was why it whispered and did not speak .
It was no dream of the gift of idle hours ,
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf :
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows ,
Not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
( Pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake .
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows .
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make .
Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
I hear America singing , the varied carols I hear ,
Those of mechanics , each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong ,
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam ,
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work , or leaves off work ,
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat , the deckhand
singing on the steamboat deck ,
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench , the hatter singing as
he stands ,
The wood-cutter "s song , the ploughboy "s on his way in the morning ,
or at noon intermission or at sundown ,
The delicious singing of the mother , or of the young wife at work ,
or of the girl sewing or washing ,
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else ,
The day what belongs to the day — at night the party of young
fellows , robust , friendly ,
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs .
O Captain!
my Captain!
our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
But O heart!
heart!
heart!
O the bleeding drops of red,
Where on the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.
O Captain!
my Captain!
rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
Here Captain!
dear father!
This arm beneath your head!
It is some dream that on the deck,
You’ve fallen cold and dead.
My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
But I with mournful tread,
Walk the deck my Captain lies,
Fallen cold and dead.
If I when my wife is sleeping
and the baby and Kathleen
are sleeping
and the sun is a flame-white disc
in silken mists above shining trees ,—
if I in my north room
danse naked , grotesquely
before my mirror
waving my shirt round my head
and singing softly to myself :
“I am lonely, lonely.
I was born to be lonely .
I am best so !”
If I admire my arms , my face,
my shoulders , flanks , buttocks
against the yellow drawn shades ,—
who shall say I am not
the happy genius of my household ?
OLD age is
a flight of small
cheeping birds
skimming
bare trees above a snow glaze.
Gaining and failing
they are buffeted
by a dark wind--
But what?
On harsh weedstalks
the flock has rested,
the snow
is covered with broken
seedhusks
and the wind tempered
by a shrill
piping of plenty.
My love is like to ice, and I to fire:
How comes it then that this her cold so great
Is not dissolved through my so hot desire,
But harder grows the more I her entreat?
Or how comes it that my exceeding heat
Is not allayed by her heart-frozen cold,
But that I burn much more in boiling sweat,
And feel my flames augmented manifold?
What more miraculous thing may be told,
That fire, which all things melts, should harden ice,
And ice, which is congeal"s with senseless cold,
Should kindle fire by wonderful device?
Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
That it can alter all the course of kind.
Of this worlds theatre in which we stay,
My love like the spectator ydly sits
Beholding me that all the pageants play,
Disguysing diversly my troubled wits.
Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits,
And mask in myrth lyke to a comedy:
Soone after when my joy to sorrow flits,
I waile and make my woes a tragedy.
Yet she, beholding me with constant eye,
Delights not in my merth nor rues my smart:
But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cry
She laughs and hardens evermore her heart.
What then can move her?
if nor merth nor mone,
She is no woman, but a senceless stone.
Happy the man whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound ,
Content to breathe his native air ,
In his own ground .
Whose herds with milk , whose fields with bread ,
Whose flocks supply him with attire ,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade ,
In winter fire .
Blest , who can unconcern"dly find
Hours , days , and years slide soft away ,
In health of body , peace of mind ,
Quiet by day ,
Sound sleep by night ; study and ease ,
Together mixt ; sweet recreation ;
And Innocence , which most does please
With meditation .
Thus let me live , unseen , unknown ,
Thus unlamented let me die ,
Steal from the world , and not a stone
Tell where I lie .

o
baby
i
wouldn"t like
Death if Death
were
good:for
when(instead of stopping to think)you
begin to feel of it,dying
"s miraculous
why?
be
cause dying is
perfectly natural;perfectly
putting
it mildly lively(but
Death
is strictly
scientific
&amp; artificial &amp;
evil &amp; legal)
we thank thee
god
almighty for dying
(forgive us,o life!
the sin of Death
i carry your heart with me(i carry it in
my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done
by only me is your doing,my darling)
                                 i fear
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you
here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that"s keeping the stars apart
i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)
In vain , in vain — the all-composing Hour
Resistless falls : the Muse obeys the Pow"r .
She comes !
she comes !
the sable Throne behold
Of Night primæval and of Chaos old !
Before her , Fancy "s gilded clouds decay ,
And all its varying Rain-bows die away .
Wit shoots in vain its momentary fires ,
The meteor drops , and in a flash expires .
As one by one , at dread Medea "s strain ,
The sick"ning stars fade off th ’ ethereal plain ;
As Argus ’ eyes by Hermes ’ wand opprest ,
Clos "d one by one to everlasting rest ;
Thus at her felt approach , and secret might ,
Art after Art goes out , and all is Night .
See skulking Truth to her old cavern fled ,
Mountains of Casuistry heap "d o"er her head !
Philosophy , that lean "d on Heav"n before ,
Shrinks to her second cause , and is no more .
Physic of Metaphysic begs defence ,
And Metaphysic calls for aid on Sense !
See Mystery to Mathematics fly !
In vain !
they gaze , turn giddy , rave , and die .
Religion blushing veils her sacred fires ,
And unawares Morality expires .
For public Flame , nor private , dares to shine ;
Nor human Spark is left , nor Glimpse divine !
Lo !
thy dread Empire , CHAOS !
is restor "d ;
Light dies before thy uncreating word ;
Thy hand , great Anarch !
lets the curtain fall ,
And universal Darkness buries All .
I "m nobody !
Who are you ?
Are you nobody , too ?
Then there ‘ s a pair of us
— do n"t tell !
They ‘ d banish us , you know .
How dreary to be somebody !
How public , like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog !
Marke but this flea , and marke in this ,
How little that which thou deny"st me is ;
It suck "d me first , and now sucks thee ,
And in this flea , our two bloods mingled bee ;
Thou know"st that this cannot be said
A sinne , nor shame , nor losse of maidenhead ,
Yet this enjoyes before it wooe ,
And pamper "d swells with one blood made of two ,
And this , alas , is more then wee would doe .
Oh stay , three lives in one flea spare ,
Where wee almost , yea more then maryed are .
This flea is you and I , and this
Our mariage bed , and mariage temple is ;
Though parents grudge , and you , w"are met ,
And cloysterd in these living walls of Jet .
Though use make you apt to kill mee ,
Let not to that , selfe murder added bee ,
And sacrilege , three sinnes in killing three .
Cruell and sodaine , hast thou since
Purpled thy naile , in blood of innocence ?
Wherein could this flea guilty bee ,
Except in that drop which it suckt from thee ?
Yet thou triumph"st , and saist that thou
Find"st not thy selfe , nor mee the weaker now ;
‘ Tis true , then learne how false , feares bee ; 25
Just so much honor , when thou yeeld"st to mee ,
Will wast , as this flea "s death tooke life from thee .
NOW the bright morning-star, Day’s harbinger,
Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her
The flowery May, who from her green lap throws
The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.
Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire
Mirth, and youth, and warm desire!
Woods and groves are of thy dressing;
Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing.
Thus we salute thee with our early song,
And welcome thee, and wish thee long.
I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said : Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert ...
Near them , on the sand ,
Half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown ,
And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command ,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things ,
The hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed :
And on the pedestal these words appear :
‘ My name is Ozymandias , king of kings :
Look on my works , ye Mighty , and despair !
’
Nothing beside remains .
Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away .
Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast
In a field I looked into going past,
And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,
But a few weeds and stubble showing last.
The woods around it have it--it is theirs.
All animals are smothered in their lairs.
I am too absent-spirited to count;
The loneliness includes me unawares.
And lonely as it is that loneliness
Will be more lonely ere it will be less--
A blanker whiteness of benighted snow
With no expression, nothing to express.
They cannot scare me with their empty spaces
Between stars--on stars where no human race is.
I have it in me so much nearer home
To scare myself with my own desert places.
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
A noiseless patient spider ,
I mark "d where on a little promontory it stood isolated ,
Mark "d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding ,
It launch "d forth filament , filament , filament out of itself ,
Ever unreeling them , ever tirelessly speeding them .
And you O my soul where you stand ,
Surrounded , detached , in measureless oceans of space ,
Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , seeking the spheres to
connect them ,
Till the bridge you will need be form "d , till the ductile anchor hold ,
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere , O my soul .
I wandered through each chartered street ,
Near where the chartered Thames does flow ,
A mark in every face I meet ,
Marks of weakness , marks of woe .
In every cry of every man ,
In every infant "s cry of fear ,
In every voice , in every ban ,
The mind-forged manacles I hear :
How the chimney-sweeper "s cry
Every blackening church appalls ,
And the hapless soldier "s sigh
Runs in blood down palace-walls .
But most , through midnight streets I hear
How the youthful harlot "s curse
Blasts the new-born infant "s tear ,
And blights with plagues the marriage-hearse .
AT ten A.M. the young housewife
moves about in negligee behind
the wooden walls of her husband"s house.
I pass solitary in my car.
Then again she comes to the curb
to call the ice-man, fish-man, and stands
shy, uncorseted, tucking in
stray ends of hair, and I compare her
to a fallen leaf.
The noiseless wheels of my car
rush with a crackling sound over
dried leaves as I bow and pass smiling.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high over Vales and Hills ,
When all at once I saw a crowd
A host of dancing Daffodills ;
Along the Lake , beneath the trees ,
Ten thousand dancing in the breeze .
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced , but they
Outdid the sparkling waves in glee :—
A Poet could not but be gay
In such a laughing company :
I gazed — and gazed — but little thought
What wealth the shew to me had brought :
For oft when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood ,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude ,
And then my heart with pleasure fills ,
And dances with the Daffodils .
